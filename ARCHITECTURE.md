# Architecture

## Purpose

Browser Hardware Diagnostics is a browser-first toolkit for testing hardware capabilities without native installs.

## Layers

### 1. Diagnostics primitives

Reusable logic that talks to browser APIs such as:

- Gamepad API
- Keyboard events
- Pointer / wheel events
- Screen / fullscreen APIs
- MediaDevices / Web Audio APIs

### 2. Presentation components

UI components render diagnostic state and provide interactive controls for testing.

Examples:

- button state panels
- axis visualizers
- keyboard layouts
- refresh-rate charts
- waveform / spectrum displays
- tone generator controls

### 3. Page-level tool composition

Each tool page composes primitives plus UI into a focused diagnostic workflow.

Current tool modules:

- gamepad
- keyboard
- mouse
- monitor
- microphone
- speakers

### 4. Sponsor / adopter boundary

The open-source repository stops at the shared technical toolkit.

Branded production deployments can add:

- custom branding
- localization
- SEO layers
- monetization systems
- distribution logic

Those are intentionally outside the core architecture boundary.

### 5. Validation boundary

The public repository intentionally keeps only thin public validation for repository, branding, and boundary checks.

Comprehensive browser and device evaluation work stays private as private evaluation assets, including browser / device regression suites, golden datasets, hidden fixtures, and tolerance thresholds.

## Design principles

- browser-native first
- testable utility logic
- minimal dependencies
- accessible UI
- static-host friendly
- clear separation between toolkit and branded deployment
