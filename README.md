**Open-source browser hardware diagnostics toolkit.**

Maintained by **[OneSpiral](https://github.com/OneSpiral)**.  
Sponsored by **[hwprobe.com](https://hwprobe.com)**.

This repository is the neutral, community-facing technical solution for browser-based hardware testing. It is meant to be improved in public so the ecosystem can collectively expand browser hardware diagnostics capabilities.

## Why this repository exists

This project exists to provide a reusable toolkit for testing hardware directly in the browser:

- gamepad input diagnostics
- keyboard state and rollover testing
- mouse click / movement / scroll testing
- monitor refresh and dead-pixel checks
- microphone capture diagnostics
- speaker / tone playback testing

The branded production website is **not** the repository itself.

Instead:

- this repo is the **technical solution**
- **hwprobe.com** is a sponsored production adopter
- **OneSpiral** maintains the open-source core
- community contributors can help improve technical capabilities for everyone

## Live production adopter

The primary sponsored production deployment is:

- **hwprobe.com** → https://hwprobe.com

That site can sponsor the open-source project with high-quality backlinks, adoption proof, and real-world usage, while the repository stays neutral and open for broader community contribution.

## Repository boundary

This repository contains:

- browser API integrations
- UI components for diagnostics
- testable core logic
- local development workflow
- public technical documentation

This repository does **not** contain the private growth stack for any branded deployment.

See [SPONSORING.md](./SPONSORING.md) for the sponsor / maintainer / production boundary.

If GitHub Sponsors is not yet enabled on the account, the funding metadata still falls back cleanly to the maintainer profile.
